## PROJECT NAME EMPLOYEE TEAM GENERATOR

## DESCRIPTION 
This project uses node, jest and inquirer to generate a HTML application which
allows the user to add engineers and interns to the team. Project includes test files using Jest.

No installation required. The package.json file was updated to include parameters for Jest.  Inquirer@8.2. was installed.

## USAGE 
User types 'npm install' followed by 'node index.js'. Open './dist/index.HTML' in the default browser to see the generated index.HTML. To run the tests, type 'npm test'.
